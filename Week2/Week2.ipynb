To preprocess the categorical variables so that they're ready for further computation, we need to avoid the current string format of the values. This means the next step for each categorical variable is to transform the string values to numeric ones, that correspond to a unique integer ID representative of each distinct category. This process is called label encoding and you can read more about it [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/categorical.html).\n",
